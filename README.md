2. install the plugin via the admin-panel
3. make sure you correctly define the "jadice web toolkit server" field in the plugin installation process (e.g. http://myicnhost/p8integration , see below)
4. create a view-mapping for the new plugin in the admin-panel
5. make sure the view-mapping is applied for the desired desktop


### jadice web toolkit installation 

1. deploy the webtoolkit-content-navigator-integration WAR-file to the same application server as the Content Navigator. this is mandatory as the Content Navigator enforces same-origin-policy
2. deploy the WAR-file with the context path "p8integration" so that it is reachable via e.g. http://myicnhost/p8integration (where Content Navigator is accessible via http://myicnhost/navigator )

## Development

- Get a j2ee.jar (e.g. from your Application server) and place it under /lib
- Get navigatorAPI.jar from Content Navigator and place it under /lib
- Run maven task e.g. `mvn install`
